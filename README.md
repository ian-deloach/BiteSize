# Ian DeLoach Indie Project

### Problem Statement
Having a long list of To-Dos is daunting to get started with, and it can make it feel like progress is going at a snail's pace. Working out a to-do list for the day makes it easy to give yourself the easy tasks and to leave yourself with a clump of stressing tasks for the future you to take care of. With BiteSize, simply put in the tasks you need to done while labeling the difficult tasks, and BiteSize will do the work for you. A todo list for each day of the week will be generated based on what work is needed to be done, and a difficult task will be assigned at the beginning of each list.
