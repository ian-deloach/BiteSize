-Renamed the project to "BiteSize"

This caused a lot of issues with Maven, so I had to take the time to learn how to redefine the project structure and how it is built. For a while,  starting the server would cause a 404 error as it was still using the previous war file name. It was difficult to find a solution for this online, but I was able to solve it on my own. In hindsight, it was a good exercise to get a better understanding on the inner workings of Maven and Tomcat.
